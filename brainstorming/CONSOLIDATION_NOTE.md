# Documentation Consolidation (2026-01-11)

The following files have been consolidated into **PROJECT_STATUS.md**:

- ❌ `DESIGN_SUMMARY.md` (337 lines)
- ❌ `RUST_ARCHITECTURE.md` (655 lines)
- ❌ `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (1322 lines)

**Total removed**: 2314 lines of redundant documentation

## Why?

These three files had significant overlap and became difficult to maintain. They were combined into a single, up-to-date document that reflects the current state of the project.

## What remains?

- ✅ **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Single source of truth for implementation status
- ✅ **SESSION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed technical reference for parsers
- ✅ **DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md** - Practical development guide
- ✅ **UI_DESIGN_COMPARISON.md** - Design decision documentation
- ✅ **SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Search implementation rationale
- ✅ **README.md** - Index to all documentation

## Result

Cleaner, more maintainable documentation that actually reflects the project's current state rather than initial design aspirations.
